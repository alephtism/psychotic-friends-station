  The Lentynox are an alien species of big cat-like people hailing from the jungle planet of Naviara.

  ## Diet

  The Lentynox have similar diets to Earth cats, being unable to metabolize Theobromine or Allicin, and while they are
  technically omnivorous, their stomachs cannot metabolize non-protein-based foods as well, only gaining half as much hunger
  back from them. They can, however, eat raw meat without any consequences.

  ## Claws

  The Lentynox have sharp, retractable claws, which deal [color=orange]Slashing[/color] damage.

  ## Damage

  Hailing from a hot jungle planet, Lentynoxes are more adapted to higher temperatures than other common species, and as
  a result, they handle colder temperatures worse, and suffer 5% more [color=cornflowerblue]Cold[/color] damage.

  ## Sharp Hearing

  Lentynoxes's have sensitive ears, being able to hear crewmember's talk 20% further than other species. However, this
  makes them more vulnerable to being flashbanged, being stunned 2x longer than other species.
